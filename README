📘 Study Planner Website – Detailed Explanation

The Study Planner Website is a simple web-based application designed to help students plan, organize, and manage their study schedules efficiently.
Many students struggle with time management and often forget what subject to study and when. This project solves that problem by providing a clear and structured way to plan daily and weekly study activities.

The website is developed using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to understand and suitable for beginners who are learning web development.

🔍 How the Website Works

The website provides an input form where the user can enter:

Subject name (what they plan to study)

Day of the week

Time duration for studying that subject

When the user clicks the “Add to Schedule” button:

JavaScript collects the entered data.

The input values are validated to ensure no field is left empty.

The data is then dynamically added to a table.

The table displays the complete weekly study schedule in a clear format.

This allows the user to quickly view and manage their study plan.
